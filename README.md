💡 Business Insights

Thursday and Tuesday showed the highest tweet activity and engagements, indicating prime posting days.

Media Views (89K) and Impressions (781K) highlight strong reach; however, the engagement rate (0.04%) indicates scope for improving tweet interactivity.

Likes (7.8K) significantly outweigh retweets (402), showing users prefer passive engagement over content sharing.

URL Clicks are highest for top-performing tweets with longer word counts, suggesting detailed content attracts more user interest.
